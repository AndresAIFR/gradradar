# Contact Queue Implementation Plan - COMPLETED ✅
*Comprehensive Step-by-Step Guide*

## ✅ IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: COMPLETE
All flowchart logic enhancements have been successfully implemented including:
- Dynamic cooldown periods based on contact success (3-7 days)
- Flexible snooze dropdown options (1,3,5,10,30 days) 
- 100-day safety net with proper categorization as contact-slip
- Enhanced contact slip detection with failed attempt priority boost
- Complete documentation updates

## Overview
Built a three-panel contact management system with intelligent prioritization algorithm to systematically manage alumni outreach.

## Phase 1: Foundation & Data Structure

### Step 1.1: Database Schema Updates
- [ ] Add new fields to `alumni` table:
  - `pinned` (boolean) - manual priority override
  - `snoozedUntil` (date, nullable) - temporary queue removal
  - `doNotContact` (boolean) - permanent exclusion
  - `queueSkippedUntil` (date, nullable) - daily skip functionality
- [ ] Run database migration with `npm run db:push`
- [ ] Update TypeScript types in `shared/schema.ts`

### Step 1.2: Algorithm Implementation
- [ ] Create `client/src/utils/contactQueueAlgorithm.ts`
- [ ] Implement core priority calculation functions:
  - `calculateContactRecency()` - Recent/Moderate/Distant/Stale buckets
  - `detectContactSlip()` - identify slipping contacts
  - `detectTrackSlip()` - identify declining tracking status
  - `calculateFirstTouchPriority()` - support + school status sorting
  - `shouldExcludeFromQueue()` - hard gates logic
  - `generatePriorityQueue()` - main orchestrator function
- [ ] Add comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for queue items
- [ ] Include detailed comments explaining each priority level

### Step 1.3: API Endpoints
- [ ] Create `GET /api/contact-queue` endpoint in `server/routes.ts`
- [ ] Implement queue data fetching with proper joins
- [ ] Add queue action endpoints:
  - `POST /api/contact-queue/complete` - mark contact completed
  - `POST /api/contact-queue/snooze` - temporarily remove from queue
  - `POST /api/contact-queue/skip` - skip for today
  - `POST /api/contact-queue/pin` - manual priority override
  - `POST /api/contact-queue/unpin` - remove manual priority

## Phase 2: Component Architecture

### Step 2.1: Page Structure
- [ ] Create `client/src/pages/ContactQueue.tsx`
- [ ] Implement three-panel layout:
  - Left panel: 25% width - queue list
  - Middle panel: 35% width - contact workspace
  - Right panel: 40% width - alumni detail view
- [ ] Add responsive breakpoints for mobile/tablet
- [ ] Implement panel resizing (optional enhancement)

### Step 2.2: Queue List Component
- [ ] Create `client/src/components/ContactQueueItem.tsx`
- [ ] Design queue item card with:
  - Alumni name and cohort year
  - Priority level indicator (color-coded)
  - Days since last contact
  - Quick action buttons (pin, snooze, skip)
  - Priority reason tooltip
- [ ] Implement virtual scrolling for large lists (if needed)
- [ ] Add keyboard navigation support

### Step 2.3: Contact Workspace Component
- [ ] Create `client/src/components/ContactWorkspace.tsx`
- [ ] Extract note-taking functionality from `AlumniDetail.tsx`
- [ ] Reuse `InlineNoteForm.tsx` with context modifications
- [ ] Add queue-specific features:
  - "Mark as Contacted" button
  - Auto-populate contact type based on queue priority
  - Quick complete workflow
- [ ] Include recent interactions display using `InteractionCard.tsx`

### Step 2.4: Alumni Detail Integration
- [ ] Modify `AlumniDetail.tsx` for embedded use
- [ ] Create width-adjusted version for right panel
- [ ] Remove navigation elements when used in queue context
- [ ] Maintain full functionality (tabs, editing, etc.)

## Phase 3: User Interface & Experience

### Step 3.1: Navigation Integration
- [ ] Add "Contact Queue" link to `client/src/components/Sidebar.tsx`
- [ ] Choose appropriate icon (ClipboardCheck, ListTodo, or Target)
- [ ] Add route to `client/src/App.tsx`
- [ ] Ensure proper active state highlighting

### Step 3.2: Queue Actions UI
- [ ] Design action buttons with clear icons:
  - Pin: PushPin icon with yellow/amber styling
  - Snooze: Clock icon with blue styling
  - Skip: ArrowDown icon with gray styling
  - Complete: CheckCircle icon with green styling
- [ ] Add confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- [ ] Implement undo functionality for accidental actions
- [ ] Add bulk action capabilities (select multiple items)

### Step 3.3: Visual Design System
- [ ] Create priority level color scheme:
  - Level 1 (Manual Follow-ups): Red/urgent colors
  - Level 2 (Contact Slip): Orange/warning colors
  - Level 3 (Track Slip): Yellow/caution colors
  - Level 4 (First Touch): Blue/info colors
- [ ] Design queue item states (selected, hovered, completed)
- [ ] Add empty state designs for each panel
- [ ] Implement loading states and skeleton screens

## Phase 4: Data Management & State

### Step 4.1: React Query Integration
- [ ] Create query keys in `client/src/lib/queryKeys.ts`:
  - `contactQueue` - main queue data
  - `queueActions` - action tracking
- [ ] Implement optimistic updates for queue actions
- [ ] Add proper cache invalidation strategies
- [ ] Handle real-time queue updates (if multiple users)

### Step 4.2: Local State Management
- [ ] Implement selected alumni state (for middle/right panels)
- [ ] Add queue filters and search functionality
- [ ] Manage panel visibility and sizing
- [ ] Handle keyboard shortcuts and hotkeys

### Step 4.3: Persistence & Sync
- [ ] Save user preferences (panel sizes, filters)
- [ ] Implement queue position memory
- [ ] Add auto-save for incomplete notes
- [ ] Handle offline scenarios gracefully

## Phase 5: Advanced Features & Polish

### Step 5.1: Queue Management Features
- [ ] Add queue statistics dashboard:
  - Total alumni in queue
  - Overdue follow-ups count
  - Average days since last contact
  - Completion rate metrics
- [ ] Implement queue filtering:
  - By priority level
  - By cohort year
  - By tracking status
  - By days overdue
- [ ] Add search functionality across queue

### Step 5.2: Workflow Optimization
- [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts:
  - Arrow keys for navigation
  - Enter to select alumni
  - Spacebar to mark complete
  - Number keys for quick actions
- [ ] Implement auto-advance (move to next after completing)
- [ ] Add batch processing capabilities
- [ ] Create daily queue review summary

### Step 5.3: Integration Points
- [ ] Connect with existing interaction tracking

## Phase 6: Testing & Deployment

### Step 6.1: Component Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for algorithm functions
- [ ] Component tests for queue items
- [ ] Integration tests for three-panel layout
- [ ] End-to-end workflow testing

### Step 6.2: Performance Optimization
- [ ] Implement efficient data loading
- [ ] Add pagination for large queues
- [ ] Optimize re-rendering with React.memo
- [ ] Profile and optimize algorithm performance

### Step 6.3: User Acceptance & Feedback
- [ ] Create usage documentation
- [ ] Gather initial user feedback
- [ ] Refine based on real-world usage
- [ ] Monitor adoption and effectiveness metrics

## Technical Considerations

### Database Performance
- Add indexes for queue query optimization:
  - `(pinned, snoozedUntil, doNotContact)`
  - `(lastContactDate, trackingStatus)`
  - `(followUpDate, followUpPriority)`

### Memory Management
- Implement pagination to handle large alumni datasets
- Use React.memo for queue items to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Consider virtual scrolling for very large queues

### Error Handling
- Graceful degradation when algorithm fails
- Fallback sorting when complex priority fails
- Clear error messages for failed actions

### Mobile Responsiveness
- Stack panels vertically on mobile
- Optimize touch interactions
- Ensure readable text and tap targets

## Success Metrics
