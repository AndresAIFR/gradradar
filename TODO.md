# GradRadar - TODO List

## Current Implementation - Smart Contact Queue

### Contact Queue Page Implementation Plan

**Three-panel layout:**
- **Left Panel** (25%): Task queue list
- **Middle Panel** (35%): Contact workspace with note form  
- **Right Panel** (40%): Alumni detail view

**Component Architecture:**
```
/client/src/pages/ContactQueue.tsx           // Main page
/client/src/components/ContactQueueItem.tsx  // Individual queue item
/client/src/components/ContactWorkspace.tsx  // Middle panel workspace
/client/src/utils/contactQueueAlgorithm.ts   // Priority sorting logic
```

**Reused Components:**
- `AlumniDetail.tsx` (right panel, width-adjusted)
- `InlineNoteForm.tsx` (middle panel)
- `InteractionCard.tsx` (recent notes display)

**Priority Algorithm (Final Version):**
1. **Hard Gates:** DNC, Snoozed, Cooldown
2. **Due Gate:** High/Normal/Low only when due; Urgent always due
3. **Priority Stack:**
   - Pinned & Due ‚Üí Fix Info ‚Üí Manual Follow-ups (Urgent‚ÜíHigh‚ÜíNormal‚ÜíLow) ‚Üí Contact Slip ‚Üí Track Slip ‚Üí First Touch
4. **Sort Keys:** Overdue ‚Üì, Since-last ‚Üì, Risk ‚Üì, A‚ÜíZ

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Fix/improve note components first for reusability
2. Create basic page structure and algorithm
3. Integrate existing components with width adjustments
4. Add complete/snooze/skip actions

## Major UI/UX Redesign Ideas

### Dashboard-First Approach
**Philosophy**: Transform from "student list with features" to "business intelligence platform for tutors"

**Main Dashboard Structure**:
- **Today's Focus Section**
  - Today's Sessions (live cards with quick-access session notes)
  - Action Items (overdue homework, students needing follow-up, pending parent responses)
  - Quick Stats (weekly revenue, active students, average score improvements)

- **Performance Overview Section**
  - Business Health Dashboard (MRR, retention rates, session completion)
  - Student Progress Heat Map (visual grid with color-coded progress indicators)
  - Trending Insights ("Emma's SAT up 150 points", "3 students ready for real exams")

- **Recent Activity Section**
  - Session Notes Feed (recent sessions with quick preview/editing)
  - Communication Queue (pending emails, text confirmations, follow-ups)
  - Upcoming Deadlines (test dates, homework due dates, payments)

**Secondary Dashboards**:
- Student Overview Dashboard (smart cards with priority sorting, quick actions)
- Analytics Dashboard (revenue trends, teaching effectiveness, success patterns)
- Communications Dashboard (parent relationship health, message templates, feedback)

**Key UX Principles**:
- Contextual Intelligence (adapts based on time/day/events)
- One-Click Actions (start notes, send updates, schedule - all from dashboard)
- Progressive Disclosure (overview ‚Üí details ‚Üí editing)
- Proactive Insights (plateau warnings, response tracking, scheduling gaps)

**Mental Model Shift**: From "I have students to manage" to "I run a tutoring business to optimize"

## Critical Bugs

- [ ] **Logan University Processing Issue** - Client-side college mapping stops processing partway through alphabetically after "NEW YORK UNIVERSITY", causing Logan University to never reach mapping logic despite existing in both CSV and IPEDS data. Root cause: Processing halt appears to be client-side synchronous processing issue, not API limits or data availability.

## Technical Debt

- [ ] Add comprehensive error boundaries
- [ ] Implement proper loading states for all async operations
- [ ] Add unit tests for critical business logic
- [ ] Optimize database queries with proper indexing
- [ ] Add API rate limiting and security headers
- [ ] Implement proper logging and monitoring

## Configuration Needed

- OpenAI API key for AI features
- Resend API key for email functionality
- SMS provider setup for notifications
- Calendar integration (Google Calendar, Outlook)
